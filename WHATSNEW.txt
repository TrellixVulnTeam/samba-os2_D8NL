                   =================================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.4.0pre1
			    April 30, 2009
                   =================================


This is the first preview release of Samba 3.4.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.


Major enhancements in Samba 3.4.0 include:
------------------------------------------

General changes:
o Samba4 and Samba3 sources are included in the tarball

Authentication Changes:
o Changed the way smbd handles untrusted domain names given during user
  authentication.

Printing Changes:
o Various fixes including printer change notificiation for Samba spoolss
  print servers.

Internal changes:
o The remaining hand-marshalled DCE/RPC services (ntsvcs, svcctl, eventlog
  and spoolss) were replaced by autogenerated code based on PIDL.
o Samba3 and Samba4 do now share a common tevent library.
o The code has been cleaned up and the major basic interfaces are shared with
  Samba4 now.
o An asynchronous API has been added.


General Changes
===============

On the way towards a standalone Samba AD domain controller, Samba3 and Samba4
branches can be built as "merged" build. That's why Samba3 and Samba4 sources
are included in the tarball. The merged build is possible in Samba 3.4.0, but
disabled by default. To learn more about the merged build,
please see http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Franky.

According to this one, there is no "source" directory included in the tarball at
all. Samba3 sources are located in "source3", Samba4 sources are located in
"source4". The libraries have been moved to the toplevel directory.

To build plain Samba3, please change to "source3" and start the build as usual.
To build Samba4 as well, please use the "--enable-merged-build" configure
option.


Authentication Changes
======================

Previously, when Samba was a domain member and a client was connecting using an
untrusted domain name, such as BOGUS\user smbd would remap the untrusted
domain to the primary domain smbd was a member of and attempt authentication
using that DOMAIN\user name.  This differed from how a Windows member server
would behave.  Now, smbd will replace the BOGUS name with it's SAM name.  In
the case where smbd is acting as a PDC this will be DOMAIN\user.  In the case
where smbd is acting as a domain member server this will be WORKSTATION\user.
Thus, smbd will never assume that an incoming user name which is not qualified
with the same primary domain, is part of smbd's primary domain.

While this behavior matches Windows, it may break some workflows which depended
on smbd to always pass through bogus names to the DC for verification.  A new
parameter "map untrusted to domain" can be enabled to revert to the legacy
behavior.


Printing Changes
================

The spoolss subsystem was replaced by autogenerated code based on PIDL. That fixes
several printing issues including printer change notificiation on Samba print
servers and will stabilize the printing functionality generally.
The support for spoolss printing with Windows Vista has been improved.


Internal Changes
================

The remaining hand-marshalled DCE/RPC services (ntsvcs, svcctl, eventlog and
spoolss) were replaced by autogenerated code based on PIDL.
So GÃ¼nther Deschner finally corrected one of the biggest mistakes in the
development of Samba: Hand-marshalled RPC stubs.

Thanks a lot! :-)

Samba3 and Samba4 do now share a common tevent library for fd and timer events.

The code has been cleaned up and Samba3 and Samba4 do share the major basic
interfaces now. That is why the libraries were moved to the toplevel directory.
That is one of the first steps to share code and minimize the gap between
these two versions.

An asynchronous API has been added.

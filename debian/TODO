This is an incomplete list of a number of issues that need to be fixed.


TODOs before upload to unstable

- make a list of basic tests that should be done to ensure that the package is
  acceptable for unstable (and run these tests)

- fix dependencies between packages
  - should the library packages be as the are now (eg should libsmbd0 exist as
	a separate package?)

- investigate impact of changes to libraries to reverse dependencies and plan
  transitions (if there are any)

- what is the status of the docs?

  - documentation2.patch is upstream
  - The former documentation.patch needs to be rewritten against the xml input

- Decide if we care about findsmb, and if so patch upstream to restore it

- Make install of samba-ad-dc possible when samba is installed:
  - stop smbd/winbind/... (otherwise the samba-ad-dc 'samba' daemon can't
	start)
  - convert the users to the new db, or document that this doesn't happen
	automatically

Other TODOs


- Add script to verify that headers are usable through current dependencies
  (to prevent bugs like #525888)
